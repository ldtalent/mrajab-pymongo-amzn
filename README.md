# mrajab-pymongo-amzn
Getting Started This project is a starting point for developing an Amazon Price Tracker. A few resources to get you started

Project Requirements

1.Visual Studio Code.

2.Python.

3.Internet connectivity.

How to setup and run the application

.Clone the repo on your local machine

Import Scraper.py from our Previous Project (https://github.com/learningdollars/mrajab-amzn-price-tracker/blob/master/scraper.py) and Clone it to your local machine

.Copy the project files into your Visual studio code project directory.

.Open the project.

.The last part is to call the function track() every 1 minute or 60 seconds or change it depending on your requirement.

.Note: You should not do it every second, doing so you would cross the rate limit and amazon will block you meaning you will not be able to scrap the data.
